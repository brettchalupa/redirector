# Redirector

A simple, configurable URL redirector built for Deno Deploy and edge runtimes.

## Features

- üöÄ Simple domain-based redirects (e.g., `foo.com/example` ‚Üí `bar.com/example`)
- üéØ Custom path redirects with override support
- üîí Permanent (301) or temporary (307) redirects
- ‚öôÔ∏è YAML-based configuration
- üß™ Comprehensive test suite
- üåê Deploy to Deno Deploy with automatic CI/CD

## Quick Start

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd redirector

# Configure your redirects in config.yaml
# Run the server
deno task dev
```

### Deploy to Deno Deploy

1. Fork or use this repository as a template
2. Connect your repository to [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy)
3. Configure `config.yaml` with your redirects
4. Push to main - automatic deployment handled by Deno Deploy

## Configuration

Edit `config.yaml` to configure your redirects:

```yaml
# The destination domain for default redirects
destination: example.com

# Redirect status code: 301 (permanent) or 307 (temporary)
# Default: 307
redirectStatus: 307

# Custom path redirects (optional)
# These override the default domain replacement
# Each redirect can optionally override the status code
redirects:
  - from: /biz
    to: /baz
  - from: /old-page
    to: /new-page
    status: 301
  - from: /blog
    to: https://blog.example.com
```

### How It Works

1. **Default behavior**: Replaces the incoming domain with your configured
   destination
   - `foo.com/example` ‚Üí `https://example.com/example`
   - Query parameters are preserved: `foo.com/page?q=test` ‚Üí
     `https://example.com/page?q=test`

2. **Custom redirects**: Override specific paths
   - Relative paths use the destination domain: `/biz` ‚Üí
     `https://example.com/baz`
   - Full URLs redirect directly: `/blog` ‚Üí `https://blog.example.com`

3. **Redirect type**: Configure `redirectStatus` in `config.yaml` to use 301
   (permanent) or 307 (temporary, default)

## Development

```bash
# Run with watch mode
deno task dev

# Run tests
deno task test

# Check formatting
deno task fmt

# Run linter
deno task lint
```
